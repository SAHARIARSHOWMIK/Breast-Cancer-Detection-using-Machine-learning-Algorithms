Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project implements Machine Learning classifiers to analyze the Breast Cancer on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data Set dataset and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

Visual Representation
Visualizing data through graphs and plots to understand key patterns.
Examining the difference between malignant and benign tumors.
Identifying highly correlated features within the dataset.

The notebook explores multiple classification algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
